* makem-action
This is a GitHub action that runs [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh][makem]] on a simple Emacs Lisp package with minimal setup.
It internally uses [[https://github.com/akirak/makem.nix/][makem.nix]] to simplify the configuration.

*Warning*: At present, checkdoc seems to have an issue with spell-check support, which makes makem fail (see [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh/issues/7#issuecomment-906450059][alphapapa/makem.sh#7]]). So this action fails too. I hope the issue will be resolved in time (either checkdoc is fixed or alphapapa is back to handle the issue).
** Usage
*** Example
Below is a minimal example that lint and compile Emacs Lisp source files in the directory.

#+begin_src yaml
  name: 'Lint'
  on:
    pull_request:
      paths:
      - '**.el'
  jobs:
    lint:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akirak/makem-action@master
        with:
          min-emacs-version: 26.1
#+end_src
